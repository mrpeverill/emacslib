This is a repository to store my emacs configuration. A few commonly used packages are included as submodules so I don't need to mess around with emacs package management on other systems.

To init on a new system:
* emacs init.el.template
* C-h v user-init-file to find system init.el
* C-x C-w the template file over init.el
